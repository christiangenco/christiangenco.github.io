Skip to 1:50 in the video for the interesting bit.

My third year at SMU, I joined a small team of innovators led by [Charlton Roberts](http://www.linkedin.com/in/charltonroberts) to explore the integration of theater and technology.

I saw this as the perfect opportunity to implement a project I'd been playing around with for the past year: the idea of an augmented shadow. I used a [Microsoft Kinect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect) to seperate out a dancer from the background, digitally alter it, and then project it back where a shadow would logicaly be.

In collaboration with [Allison Leopold](http://www.facebook.com/allison.leopold.3), we put together a short performance that used different methods of augmentation.

The entire project is coded in [Processing](http://processing.org/) and makes extensive use of the [Processing Kinect Library](https://github.com/shiffman/libfreenect/tree/master/wrappers/java/processing) (here's an [excellent guide](http://www.shiffman.net/p5/kinect/) for how to get started).

If you're curious, here's the [uncommented and super hacky source code](https://github.com/christiangenco/Kinect-Shadow-Dance) on Github.
