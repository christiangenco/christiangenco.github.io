I’ve been meaning to write something about the CSS at Medium for a while because I’m not completely ashamed of it…

So how did that happen? What did we do differently? OMG, how can you do the same thing? Or learn from us, or something?

What follows are some notes on our CSS, the steps we’ve taken to get it to where it is, and the world we live in today.

## In the beginning (some history)

### H3 Example

Roughly 2 years ago I joined Obvious Corp. to work on the software application, medium.com (which, you’re ~hopefully~ reading on).

At the time, Medium had already gone through a series of "re-styles" (*A re-style is where designers ruin your life by coming up with something prettier than they had previously come up with, resulting in you having to rewrite a bunch of CSS/LESS/SASS/etc*). Because of these re-styles, there was a lot of built up cruft – the company was leaning pretty heavily on LESS’s language features, with page driven semantics, non-sprited/non-retina image assets, and other such things.
