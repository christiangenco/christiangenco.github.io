        <p><a href="/you-should-learn-to-program">Coding is a useful skill</a>, even if you don&#39;t work as a programmer, because coding lets you to build tools that make anything you do easier.</p>
<p>After reading, writing, and understanding enough math to <a href="https://sivers.org/prog">know when you&#39;re getting cheated</a>, it&#39;s the most important skill you can learn.</p>
<p>The best way to get started is to start building stuff you want to exist. It&#39;s a win/win, because you&#39;re building your coding skills while building a useful thing for yourself, and it makes it very clear what the next thing to learn is.</p>
<p>Your goal should be to build lots of stuff. Lots of really crappy stuff at first, but knowing that it&#39;s okay that it&#39;s crappy, because it&#39;s going to get better the more stuff you build.</p>

<p>A similar idea from <a href="http://amzn.to/2jaqSzm">Art and Fear</a>:</p>

      <figure>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.huxley.net/bnw/four.html">
        <p>The ceramics teacher announced that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality.</p>
<p>His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the &quot;quantity&quot; group: fifty pounds of pots rated an &quot;A&quot;, forty pounds a &quot;B&quot;, and so on. Those being graded on &quot;quality&quot;, however, needed to produce only one pot — albeit a perfect one — to get an &quot;A&quot;.</p>
<p>Well, grading time came and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity!</p>
<p>It seems that while the &quot;quantity&quot; group was busily churning out piles of work — and learning from their mistakes — the &quot;quality&quot; group had sat around theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.</p>

    <p>It doesn&#39;t matter as much as you think it does. Once you learn your first language, it&#39;s much easier to learn a second one, and easier than that to learn a third. Ask a professional programmer how many languages they know and most will lose count between 10 and 30.</p>

<p>Christian,</p>
<p>That piece of advice towards the end of your TEDx talk at SMU really resonated with me, and I felt compelled to reach out and tell you why.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I&#39;m a 25 year old college-grad seemingly stuck between a rock and a hard place. I took a 9-to-5 job upon graduating out of necessity and it wasn&#39;t long before I found myself hating the life I had created. In May this year, I left with no plans and nothing lined up. I had enough savings to support me for a while, so I was going to use this off-time to &quot;find myself&quot; and decide on a sustainable long-term career plan.</p>
<p>About a month later I got into programming after being encouraged by my sister who was living out in San Francisco. Logic and reasoning have always been my strengths, so it seemed to be a much better fit for me than my sales job. I started teaching myself Python for free online, quickly learning the basics and developing somewhat of a passion for it. I was enamored by how much real-world potential this newly found skill had....developing apps, websites, data science, etc....there seemed to be so many career paths that I could entertain!</p>
<p>I realized that many people left jobs they hate, taught themselves how to program, and started new careers in that field.</p>
<p>I thought I found the answer to my problem!</p>
<p>I knew I could become competent and get a job in a seemingly short amount of time as long as I worked hard and gained real-world experience.</p>
<p>I then expanded my education by paying for a Techdegree program through Treehouse that would give me that experience with real-world projects.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, I soon found myself procrastinating and avoiding it all-together. I went about two solid weeks without writing a single line of code.</p>
<p>After listening to some advice from Tim Ferriss and watching some TED talks on procrastination, I realized I was putting too much pressure on myself and learned tricks to get myself back into my education. And forever whatever reason, I quashed the doubts my gut-feeling was telling me about making a career out of it.</p>
<p>I realized I needed to more-or-less, &quot;get my shit together&quot;, and get back to work.</p>
<p>I knew I needed to &quot;start with why&quot; (Simon Sinek), and so I reflected on why I started coding in the first place. I tried to find as many videos as I could of people speaking about why they became programmers and why computer science is amazing and all of that big picture stuff that I knew would help me to wrap my head around everything and revitalize the passion I once had. I wrote a list that I titled &quot;Why learn programming?&quot;, so that I could articulate my motivations and overcome my doubts.</p>
<p>Then, I stumbled on your TEDx talk at SMU from 2012.</p>
<p>I figured you would talk about some cool stuff that would reinforce my confirmation bias about why programming is awesome and how it is the solution to my problems. And you basically did....until you threw that curve ball when you said:</p>
<p>&quot;And you will feel inspired to become a programmer...DON&#39;T.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I want you to go back to what you were doing before you started to learn how to program....&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s a lot of people in the world that can program, but there&#39;s none that can also do what you know how to do.&quot;</p>
<p>Nobody else had said that, and I certainly wasn&#39;t expecting you to.</p>
<p>After letting those thoughts rattle through my head for a while, the big-picture became more clear to me - becoming a programmer wasn&#39;t the answer.</p>
<p>I was just a sailor being lured by a siren that presented itself as a high median salary with endless career opportunity. A forward-thinking industry equipped with trendy offices, ping-pong tables, and a lax dress-code. I was too desperate to consider the possibility that I was being short-sighted.</p>
<p>What you said helped me realize this and nudge me back in the right direction, which was in front of me the whole time.</p>
<p>You see, I like programming. But I love psychology and meta-cognition. Over the past 10 years or so, I&#39;ve spent thousands of hours in deep thought trying to understand myself and other people. I love learning what makes people tick and why they do the things they do. I want to help others change how they see things and overcome their problems. My nearly 6-year long undergraduate adventure ended with a degree in Psychology, yet for whatever reason, I never entertained those career paths and I now have the fresh perspective necessary to further investigate what I actually want to do with my life.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure that if I continue to spend a little time each day learning programming, I can make my life easier in one way or another. At the bare minimum, it&#39;s a fun way to improve my reasoning skills and creativity.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Anyways Christian, I just wanted to share my story with you and say thank you.</p>
<p>You helped to shift my paradigm, and I feel very grateful for that.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Matt</p>

<li>I&#39;d start here: <a href="https://sivers.org/learn-js">https://sivers.org/learn-js</a> He recommends a lot of books. If that&#39;s not your thing, check out Codecademy and Khan Academy&#39;s web development courses.</li>
<li><a href="https://javascript30.com">https://javascript30.com</a></li>
<li>&quot;My name is Daniel Jung, and I am currently a junior in high school. I was watching Ted talks when I came across your video. I am really interested in coding, but have no idea where to start.&quot; <a href="mailto:&#100;&#x61;&#110;&#x69;&#101;&#108;&#x6a;&#106;&#x75;&#110;&#x67;&#51;&#x32;&#x33;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#100;&#x61;&#110;&#x69;&#101;&#108;&#x6a;&#106;&#x75;&#110;&#x67;&#51;&#x32;&#x33;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Don&#39;t be too worried about picking the right language to start with - it doesn&#39;t really matter. Once you learn your first language, it&#39;s easy to learn more. That said, Javascript is really popular right now and looks like it&#39;ll continue being popular, so there are a lot of resources available for learning it.</p>
<p>I&#39;d get started with <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing">https://www.khanacademy.org/computing</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo</a></p>
