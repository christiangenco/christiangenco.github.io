How long would you want to live if you got to choose?

> - I take 1 gram (1,000 mg) of **NMN** every morning, along with 1 gram of **resveratrol** (shaken into [my homemade yogurt](https://www.bravo-probiotic-yogurt.com/)) and 1 gram of **metformin**.
> - I take a daily dose of **vitamin D**, **vitamin K2**, and 83 mg of **aspirin**.
> - I strive to keep my sugar, bread, and pasta intake as low as possible. I gave up desserts at age 40, though I do steal tastes.
> - I try to skip one meal a day or at least make it really small. My busy schedule almost always means that I miss lunch most days of the week.
> - Every few months, a phlebotomist comes to my home to draw my blood, which I have analyzed for dozens of biomarkers. When my levels of various markers are not optimal, I moderate them with food or exercise.
> - I try to take a lot of steps each day and walk upstairs, and I go to the gym most weekends with my son, Ben; we lift weights, jog a bit, and hang out in the sauna before dunking in an ice-cold pool.
> - I eat a lot of plants and try to avoid eating other mammals, even though they do taste good. If I work out, I will eat meat.
> - I don't smoke. I try to avoid microwaved plastic, excessive UV exposure, X-rays, and CT scans.
> - I try to stay on the cool side during the day and when I sleep at night.
> - I aim to keep my body weight or BMI in the optimal range for healthspan, which for me is 23 to 25.
