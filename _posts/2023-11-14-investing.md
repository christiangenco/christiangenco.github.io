The 4% rule, often referenced in retirement planning, originates from a study known as the Trinity study. This study was conducted by three finance professors at Trinity University in 1998. The study examined various scenarios of annual withdrawals from a retirement portfolio consisting of stocks and bonds. The 4% refers to the portion of the portfolio withdrawn in the first year, with subsequent withdrawals adjusted for inflation to keep pace with the cost of living. The study's objective was to determine "safe withdrawal rates" from retirement portfolios that could last for 30 years without being exhausted. It is important to note that the Trinity study and similar ones have faced criticism for their approaches to withdrawal strategies, highlighting the need for flexibility and adjustment based on market conditions https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study

The original Trinity study used data up to 1995, but it has been updated in subsequent studies, such as one by Pfau in 2010, using data through 2009​ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study#:~:text=The%20original%20Trinity%20study%20was,6%5D
