We actually ended up [winning](http://www.smudailycampus.com/news/theta-tau-lyle-win-sing-song), becomming [the first non-Greek organization to win in Sing Song's 25-year history](http://www.smudailycampus.com/news/tonight-sing-song-celebrates-25-years).

It was [a lot of hard work](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVd32XdAz_c), but was very rewarding to see [how much we improved](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqQMWsfILMw) each time we ran through it.

This scratched a long overdue itch for doing theatre in college.
