excerpt: "Higher vitamin D is coorelated with a healthier and longer life. What do you do with that information, though?"

After reading [an article about the importance of getting enough sun](https://www.outsideonline.com/2380751/sunscreen-sun-exposure-skin-cancer-science) in 2018, I've tried to be methodical about getting adequate amounts of sunlight. I use the terrible app recommended in that article, [dminder](http://dminder.ontometrics.com/), to make sure I'm getting at least 2,000 IUs of Vitamin D from sunlight every day it's feasible.

When tested, I was shocked to see my vitamin D levels were super low.

I've avoided taking vitamin D supplements because I think sunlight likely does a lot more than just help you make vitamin D, like [produce nitric oxide](https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_weller_could_the_sun_be_good_for_your_heart), and the positive health effects from vitamin D are probably coorelatory and not causitory. I'd like to figure out what I can do to get these levels up though, so I'm taking supplements and experimenting with a UVB lamp designed for reptile habitats.

Stay tuned for more data. I wish I had a continuous vitamin D monitor to sort this out faster than a monthly blood test.
