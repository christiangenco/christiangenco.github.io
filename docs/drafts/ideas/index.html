        So you have an idea
      </h1>
      <article class="prose lg:prose-xl dark-mode:prose-dark">
        <p>So you have an idea for the next great app/website/company/widget? Great! Ideas are the first step to how anything gets done.</p>
<p>You might have heard that you need to start by protecting your idea from people that might steal it: hire a lawyer to set up an iron-clad company structure, invest in patents, make sure anyone you talk has signed an NDA, and raise as much money as you can to grow quick enough to beat the competition.</p>
<p>For new ideas, this is usually terrible advice.</p>
<p>It&#39;s terrible advice because you don&#39;t have anything worth protecting yet. Ideas aren&#39;t worth anything in themselves, <a href="https://sivers.org/multiply">they&#39;re just a multiplier on execution</a>. Your one big idea needs thousands of smaller ideas to support it before it can live on its own.</p>
<p>If you have an app idea, and you&#39;ve never made an app before, chances are your execution isn&#39;t going to be very good and your idea isn&#39;t as great as you think it is.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s okay! The way to get better is to just keep creating.</p>

    <p>Strip it down to <a href="https://sivers.org/infinity">version 0.1</a>, or you&#39;ll get something impossible like:</p>

        <blockquote cite="https://www.huxley.net/bnw/four.html">
        <p>It&#39;s a social networking e-commerce portal for live music, where everyone creates a profile to enter all their dates, if they&#39;re a musician or venue, or their available dates if they&#39;re a music fan. Then we connect the fans with artists&#39; dates. Then we can sell the tickets for the events, and give a digital download preview of the music. After the show, the artist uploads the video from the night, and people can purchase the video of the show they were at, and connect with other people who attended that same show to create tribes of people, who will recommend other music you may like if you like that. Oh and it will have a dating component, and real-time chat. -- <a href="https://sivers.org/infinity">Derek Sivers on version infinity</a></p>

    <p>A good exercise to go through to make sure your idea is stripped down to it&#39;s core (and that you really know what you&#39;re building) is to <a href="/paper">make a paper prototype</a> first.</p>
<p>Start out by making the smallest possible useful thing. You can always improve it later, and by making smaller bets you&#39;ll know when you&#39;re going in the wrong direction and what people really like.</p>

    <p>The problem is that <a href="https://estimatemyapp.com/">developers are expensive</a>. With the right leadership, their skills can be used to build billion dollar companies.</p>
<p>To make sure you&#39;re making the most of their time, make sure you have a crystal clear idea of what it is you want (again, <a href="/paper">paper prototyping</a> helps a lot with this).</p>
