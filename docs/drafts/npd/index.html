        Narcissistic Personality Disorder

        <p>I got to ask Jordan B. Peterson about NPD in person on 2018-10-11:</p>

        <blockquote cite="https://www.huxley.net/bnw/four.html">
        <p>Me: You&#39;ve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNQQIRKLPHs">spoken online about Borderline Personality Disorder</a>. Do you have any thoughts on the related cluster B disorder Narcissistic Personality Disorder?</p>
<p>JBP: I&#39;ve had Narcissistic clients. I had one who was a serial sexual predator. He was mandated by the court. If you want a hopeless clinical situation, a court mandated Narcissist...</p>
<p>I mean he doesn&#39;t want to be there. All he ever did was tell me how wonderful he was, despite the fact that he had been prosecuted quite successfully for what he had done. I tried to appeal to his narcissism - to teach him that there were certain things he probably shouldn&#39;t continue doing if he wanted to keep his wonderful self out of prison. He was absolutely impenetrable.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to say much more than that because you never see narcissists in the clinical path, right? Like they&#39;re going to come in? It&#39;s more likely they&#39;ll come in and tell you how to run your practice.</p>
<p>I had a narcissistic mother of one of my clients come and tell me that. She [had put] her daughter right into the desired permanent unconsciousness. She came into my office one day and just tore a strip off me. It was really something to watch. I could certainly understand my client a lot better.</p>
<p>That&#39;s been my experience with the narcissistic cluster so far. Did you have a more specific question?</p>
<p>Me: I think a member of my family has it. I&#39;m playing armchair psychologist and trying to figure out a successful way to handle interactions with them. From what you&#39;re saying it sounds like they&#39;re impenetrable.</p>
<p>JBP: I would say don&#39;t share any personal information with them.</p>
<p>Me: It&#39;s my mom, so.</p>
<p>JBP: Seriously, the best situation with something like that is to detach and watch and don&#39;t offer more of yourself than is absolutely necessary. That&#39;s the only strategy I really know. That might be mildly effective. Don&#39;t put up with any more than you can. If you&#39;re starting to get resentful, that&#39;s a good sign that you probably need some more distance.</p>
