I was given a sheet of [pre- and post-operative instructions for my wisdom teeth extraction](/pdf_articles/terrible-operative-instructions.pdf) that were terrible and confusing, so I rewrote them to be easier to follow.

Hey, I'm not a doctor, this is not medical advice, etc.

Also: oh my god, doctors get your shit together. How are people supposed to follow your logic puzzle discharge instructions _while_ going through surgery? Come on now you can do better.

## Before scheduling the surgery

- If you're pregnant, don't

## A week before

- arrange for someone to drive you to and from surgery (you can't drive yourself) and spend the rest of the day in the same room as you.
- plan for two days of liquid food (soylent, smoothies, soup, ice cream, yogurt, mashed potatoes, pudding, jellow, or similar)
- Get some gum
- Get an ice pack and a heat pack
- if you have fake nails or dark nail polish, get it taken off. The color of your nails is important for the anesthesiologist to make sure you're not dying.
- Don't have any alcohol, smoke, vape, or use any recreational drugs because it could mess with your tolerance to the sedative medications and you might wake up in the middle of dental surgery which would be horrifying.

## The day before

- Don't have any grapefruit because it messes with medication in ways we don't understand.
- Don't eat or drink anything (even water) after midnight. You need to have fasted for at least eight hours before your surgery (otherwise you might poop and pee all over the place while you're sedated and that'd be super embarassing)
- Mix up a big bottle of salt water to rinse your mouth out for meals (after the first 24 hours)
- Hey good job taking care of your health! Do something relaxing a few hours before bed.
- Plan some relaxing activities you can do while stationary tomorrow. Video games? Netflix binge?

## The morning of your surgery

- Hey good job taking care of your health! Remember to breath.
- wear short sleeves so the doctors can access your arms to put in an IV for sedation drugs

## Immediately after waking up from your surgery

- you might feel uncomfortable, have swelling, bleed, and not be able to open your jaw all the way: that's normal.
- gently but firmly bite down on the gauze in your mouth to control bleeding

## On your way home

- Stop by a pharmacy to pick up your prescriptions for:
  - an antibiotic (amoxicillin or cindamycin)
  - a Medrol Dose Pack (an antiinflamatory steroid)
  - Zofran, but only if you feel nautious
  - Ultracet or Tylenol and Ibuprofen for pain

## When you get home

- change your gauze and let it stay in your mouth for up to one hour (so you've had gauze in your mouth for about two hours total).
  - if bleeding is excessive, check that the gauze is as far back in your mouth as possible. You may bite on tea bags to help stop bleeding.
- lay down with your head elevated and take a nap. Blood pressure and bleeding decrease when sleeping.
- Try not to talk or move excessively.
- While your driver and post-surgery companion is hanging out in the same room as you for your nap, ask them to write out a schedule with checkboxes for when you're going to take that medication for the next week.

For pain management:

- Ultracet (2 tablets) or Tylenol #3 (1 tablet) or 2 over the counter 500mg Tylenol
- wait 4 hours
- 800mg Ibuprofen or 2 200mg over the counter Ibuprofen
- wait 4 hours
- repeat

Severe infections are rare. If you feel you are having an emergency like rapid swelling in the eye/neck, fever, difficulty breathing, excessive bleeding that cannot be stopped, visit an Emergency Room.
