You can set the stone in the wax casting and then when cast in metal the metal will automatically set the stone: [Setting Stones with Microfoundry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkmqBBBVA0c)

The [Microfoundry](https://www.etsy.com/listing/98385243/microfoundry-lost-wax-casting-system-for?ref=cart) is a tiny kit from the UK for burning out and melting your metal in a microwave. It also comes with gloves, tongs, crucibles, and mixing powder. [The Microfoundry process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiYTnCfr7NQ) seems pretty straightforward.

The small detail required in jewelery requires a resin 3D printer instead of a standard filament 3D printer. The resin printer I see [most used by jewelery-makers on YouTube](https://youtu.be/MP6dDmYJ5hQ) is the [ELEGOO Mars](https://amzn.to/3wqYE8r), which starts at $300.

You'll need to use a castable resin that will leave the casting completely and cleanly during the burn-out stage.
