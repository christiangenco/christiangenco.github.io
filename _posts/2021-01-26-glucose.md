Inspired by [Nat Eliason](https://twitter.com/nateliason), I got a continuous blood glucose monitor: [Levels](https://www.levelshealth.com/).

It was spooky putting a needle in my arm, mostly painless for the two weeks it was in. I learned that my normal diet keeps my blood glucose stable and it dips into hypoglycemia at night (which I think is okay).

![My blood glucose on a typical day was hypoglycemic at night and stayed comfortably and easily under 100](https://res.cloudinary.com/genco/image/upload/v1611629738/c/L4d2.png)

It was neat to go through the day being able to check on my phone what my blood glucose level was. I got an intuitive sense for what hunger and energy feelings coorelated with roughly what level of blood sugar. I want Levels but for everything a blood test can measure, like [LDL](/ldl) and [vitamin D](/d).

The one day I ate sushi spiked my glucose to 180â€”easily the highest it was in the entire two week period. My next highest spike was only 121, also from rice.

The sushi and data were well worth the momentary spike.

This data combined with my [out of this world LDL levels](/ldl) means, I think, that carbs from white rice are especially bad for me now that I'm fat adapted on the ketogenic diet. Going forward I'll be especially cautious of this.
