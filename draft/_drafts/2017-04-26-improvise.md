## Introduction

> I did indeed love the **rush of performing** [from high school and college theatre]. Soon, though, I became a little bored...I wanted the feeling I got when I performed without the repetitous work of the rehearsals. Performing without rehearsals, was there such a thing?

> Improvisation became my passion...I studied and performed everywhere I could...I began to form my own point of view in regard to what makes improvisation work or not. That is in this book.

## 1. What is Improvisation?

> Improvisation is getting on a stage and making stuff up as you go along.

> [This book is useless] because when it comes down to it, you can read about it until your teeth fall out, but you'll only get better by doing it. Doing it. Doing it.

## 2. Rules

1. Don't deny.
2. Don't ask questions.
3. Don't dictate action.
4. Don't talk about past or future events.
5. Establish who, what, where.
6. Don't negotiate.
7. Don't do teaching scenes.
8. Show, don't tell.
9. Say "yes," and then say "and."
10. Don't talk about what you are doing.

> I don't believe [these rules] work. That is, The Rules do not help one improvise well.

### The History of The Rules

The rules don't make good improv - something else does. If you're thinking too hard about not breaking the rules, they can cause you to have bad improv by being too analytical.

Eliminating bad practices doesn't make a scene good. People made these rules because they noticed bad scenes usually did those things, but that doesn't mean a good scene can't have them.

### Fear, Fear, Fear

For good scenes, don't be afraid (fear makes you defensive; being defensive makes you seek safety; safety is boring). Put yourself out there and make mistakes!

### Breaking the Rules

> "Don't you need to know The Rules first before you can break them?"..."No."

Learn how to do things, not how *not* to do them.

## 3. How to Improvise

### Part One: Do something!

Talking about doing things is more boring than doing them.

Initiate actions with motivation and a clear, strong position. What's your deal?

Fully commit to something unpredictable.

Don't overthink what you say to try to be funny.

Use objects as tools, not crutches.

#### Preconceiving ideas

> Is it okay to preconceive an idea in an improv scene?...yes, but it's cheating.

* don't try to manipulate a scene to fit your preconceived arrangement of beats
* don't overthink forcing a funny line (just blurt it out)
* you can fall back to a character that always works for you, but it's better to explore new ones
* choosing an emotion to start with is great, just don't always choose the same one, and don't always choose one
* pre-planning an opening line is fine if it doesn't say say too much, but it's more effective to not have a first line at all

### Part Two: Check Out What You Did

Don't analyze "why," just notice "how." Chill out and check out what you did without worrying about what comes next.

### Part Three: Hold on to What You Did

Passionate goals are way more interesting. Don't change the goal if you get stuck, change the environment.

> Be possessed with what you created and how you are doing it.

ex: Dorothy is passionate about getting back to Kansas, and must do so in an innocent way.

Don't lose your point of view, or weaken it, because you get scared.

### The Magic of Improvisation

Magic happens when you're fully immersed in your character - mind-like-water in the zone!
