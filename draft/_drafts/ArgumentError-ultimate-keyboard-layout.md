Keyboard layouts are a hotly contested subject among programmers - particularly ones that suffer from RSI or wrist strain. Popular [alternatives to the standard QWERTY layout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colemak#Non-QWERTY_keyboards_for_Latin_scripts) include DVORAK, which is particularly good for prose writers as it maximizes key alteration between the right and left hand for most english words:

and Colemak, which changes a minimal amount from QWERTY to achieve the shortest finger travel distance for most english words:

Both layouts, however, have an incredibly high barrier of entry for someone well versed in their QWERTY ways. Dropping from ~110 WPM on QWERTY to ~25 on Colemak with the promise of reaching 80 in a month is an incredibly frustrating prospect.
