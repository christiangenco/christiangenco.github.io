Are you looking for a Firebase developer to help make your web app? Do you need someone who can:

- chat with you about your business and understand what you're trying to get done and why it's important
- work with you to nail down a minimum-viable app
- charge you a fixed rate before the project starts with a **full money-back guarantee** if you're not happy with the result
- **deliver on time**

Well then I've got some good news for you: you found one! It's me. Hi. I'm Christian Genco.

I've been making websites since 2007. I love it. I do it in my free time. When I was zip-lining in Costa Rica all I could think about was how cool it would be to build an app that could automatically combine everybody's vacation photos and videos into a travel movie. My idea of the perfect weekend involves ten hours of uninterrupted coding.

I _especially_ like building things on Firebase with React. It's _so much easier_ than any other tech stack I've used before. Firebase lets me get things up and running quickly and cheaply in a way that infinitely scales and needs way less maintenance than with traditional backends.

Here's some stuff I've built for myself on Firebase:

- [Fileinbox](https://fileinbox.app/): a serverless rewrite of a profitable SaaS I built in 2013 to help people send and receive files. This project uses Firebase serverless functions and Firebase Cloud Storage to upload files on the web and move them to Dropbox and Google Drive.
- [The Video Clipper](https://thevideoclipper.com): an online video editor to make short clips from long videos and amplify them on social media
- [Midnight Time Tracker](https://midnight.app): a time tracker that tracks all your time (this is what I'll use to calculate my effective hourly rate for your project)
- [Textbooks Please](https://textbooksplease.com): a textbook search engine I made in college and then re-wrote on Firebase (my first online business!)

I've also worked with:

- **YouTuber [Ali Abdaal](https://academy.aliabdaal.com/)** to build an internal student success dashboard that tracks subsubscribers and views for thousands of students every day. I built it in about a week and a half entirely on Firebase.
- **Magician [Trigg Watson](https://triggmagic.com/)** to build a text messaging system used in most of his live performances. This project is really cool but he says I can't talk about details or it would ruin the magic.
- **SiriusXM** to build a Firebase-connected car that was used to sell car manufacturers at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) on their new product offerings.

If it sounds like we could be a good fit [grab a time with me](https://calendly.com/cgenco/firebase-development) so we can chat about what you're working on!
