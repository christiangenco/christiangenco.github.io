excerpt: A winning hackathon idea for a nightstand projector
---

My girlfriend [Elisa Farrell](http://comiccooking.blogspot.com/) and I entered an innovation competition sponsored by Texas Instruments to create an application for a pico projector enabled smartphone. The app we created, NighTech, is an information dashboard that projects key information on your ceiling at night.

Our app ended up winning second place in TI's competition and first place in the [AT&T Foundry Innovation Competition](http://www.attinnovationspace.com/innovation/story/a7779412). We both were granted an all-expense-paid trip to the Consumer Electronics Show (which was quite the experience) where we got to pitch our idea to executives of major overseas companies.

The idea never panned out to anything published, though.
