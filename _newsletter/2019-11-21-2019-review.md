excerpt: "My 2019 year in review"
---

For the third year in a row, here's my Tim Ferriss-inspired past year review! You can also read my reviews for [2017](/2017-review) (which explains what this exercise is and why I do it) and [2018](/2018-review).

You may notice that this review is significantly more verbose than the last two years. I started a habit of daily journaling at the beginning of 2019, which gave me significantly more information to look back on when compiling this review.
