Since giving a TEDx talk at [TEDxSMU](http://www.tedxsmu.org/) on why everyone should learn to program, I've gotten some amazing messages from people all over the world inspired to learn to code, but unsure what to do next.

How do you get started programming? What's the best language to learn? The options can be overwhelming and confusing, especially for beginners.

Here's what I recommend to get started coding.

## What language should I learn first?

There are [_thousands_ of languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) you could choose as your first language. Some programmers are very opinionated about what language is the best, and so strongly recommend beginners learn their favorite language first.

<!-- If you can take a class that will teach you Java or C++ in person, you'll learn all the basics of coding just fine.  -->

Here's the thing, though: **it doesn't matter what language you learn first.** Pick one, and if it turns out it's not the best language for what you want to do, it'll be _way_ easier to learn your next one.

Coding languages are very different from human languages. Once you've learned one language, it's really easy to pick up more.

For example, here's some Javascript code for doing a super basic calculation (`5 + 10`) and showing the result (`15`) on the screen:

```js
const a = 5;
const b = 10;
console.log(a + b);
```

Here's _the exact same program_ in a totally different language, Python:

```python
a = 5
b = 10
print(a + b)
```

and the same thing in Ruby:

```python
a = 5
b = 10
puts a + b
```

and the same thing in Java:

```java
class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String args[]){
    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;
    System.out.println(a + b);
  }
}
```

Alright Java is objectively gross. POINT IS once you understand some basic concepts (in this case: how to add numbers together and print them out), it's super easy to translate those concepts into different languages.

> Does this language use semicolons? Do I have to declare what type the variables are? How do I print stuff out? Alright cool I think I've got it.

In fact programmers are so good at learning new languages, it's not unusual for a seasoned programmer to be able to [pick up a new language in just a few minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/).

## How do I get started?

If you don't need to worry about what language to learn first, how do you pick what to learn? Simple - pick the way you like to learn best, and find the most enjoyable class you can.

If you like working on a laptop, I recommend:

- [Genco School](https://www.genco.school): my course teaching just enough HTML, CSS, and Javascript to be dangerous
- [Khan Academy's Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming)
- [Khan Academy's Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css)
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
- [Javascript 30 by Wes Bos](https://javascript30.com)
- [Code Sandbox](http://codesandbox.io) or [Codepen](http://codepen.io) to just play around
- [The Missing Semester of your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) video series, which teaches some very practical hands-on coding skills that will put you above what most Computer Science university graduates can do.

If you're on an iPad, I love [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) - you learn to code while playing a game!

On an iPhone, [Human Resource Machine](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/human-resource-machine/id1005098334) is super fun and a great way to learn how machines are working at a really low level. I learned and retained more from playing this game than I did in my Assembly course in an undergraduate computer science degree!
