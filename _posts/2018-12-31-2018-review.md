<a target="_blank" href="https://i.imgur.com/7F7Qh8i.jpg"><img alt="Skiing at Sipapu" src="https://i.imgur.com/7F7Qh8im.jpg" /></a>

Positive:

* started eating outrageously large breakfasts as my only meal of the day
* started doing Groove emails every day (especially feeling comfortable sorting out deliquent accounts, big cash bump)
* Focusing on Fileinbox landing page, marketing, and talking to customers
* Negotiated a small Microconf discount for doing the recap
* Sibsmas! (especially gifts to Justin, getting catering)
* Last minute trip to Panama to hang out with Trigg over Christmas (especially hiking in rainforests, practicing spanish, making a new Anki spanish vocab habit, leaf cutter ants, learning about the history of the canal, fried red snapper)
* Ski trip with DR at Sipapu (especially rest days, figuring out how to drive in snow, getting a humidifier, going back to normal breakfasts)
* Jerry Seinfield with DR and Cody M.
* Not getting sunburned in Panama or Taos :D

Negative:

* not getting very much work done in Panama
* Panama food being more expensive than I'd thought
* REI Garage Sale was disappointing. I'd go back if I had something specific to buy around camping (like a sleeping bag, sleeping mat, or tent)
* being surprised by my accounting bill

## Takeaways for 2019

* Doing stuff with DR is consistently a big positive - keep doing that. Hanging out with Luke and Trigg is also consistently great.
* Seeing shows and movies have a high rate of success to be positive experiences. Only three shows/movies out of the dozens I saw this year were so bad I didn't enjoy them (and they were the cheapest ones)
* I don't get a lot out of alcohol - it just makes me tired. I don't drink alcohol anymore.
* **Taking a longer time with fewer high quality self improvement books** helps me internalize and enact them much better. [Just Fucking Ship](/books/jfs), [12 Rules for Life](/books/12-rules), and [Atomic Habits](/books/atomic-habits) were big process improving books this year. I could spend a lot more time just on drilling these books next year and be further ahead than if I listened to 100 nonfiction books at 3x speed.
* Traveling is consistently a highlight, and I need to figure out a better way to balance work with traveling. Anxiety that I'm not getting enough work done on trips was a consistent negative. I enjoy trips much more when there's physical work I can be doing: climbing, hiking, skiing, or just walking around a cool new city.
* **Build habits instead of setting goals.** I set an ambitious goal of doing 8 poms every workday that held for a while, but when it stopped it stopped hard. My newer habit of spending one pom every day on doing Groove emails has held much better, so (in line with James Clear's Atomic Habits advice) I'll be focused more on defining the habits of the person I want to become as opposed to setting ambitious goals to hit.
* Focus on fewer projects. Apricot Book, Redux/Firestore, 30x500, Google Photos Triage, Mailto, and Winbox 0, Template Maker, and Life Timeline were all projects I worked on but didn't finish in 2018. I "shipped" Microconf Recap and several vlogs, and would've been happier focusing on fewer projects and shipping more of them. **For 2019, focus on Fileinbox and the Microconf Recap**. Everything else is a side project, and should be worked on way less.
* I think spending poms learning React and GraphQL was a good investment, and now it's time to build stuff with it.
* The biggest negative in my life for 2018 was interactions with Natalie, which I learned is because she probably has Narcicistic Personality Disorder (NPD). The overwhelming advice I've found is to limit interactions with someone with NPD, and if you can't to be very formulaic about the way you interact ("When W, I feel X. I want Y, or else Z.").
