## 1. Intro to SEO

SEO is arguably the best marketing channel. ~60% of traffic sources come from search engines (vs. ~30% direct, ~6% social, ~1% email, and ~0.5% display ads). Search traffic is also high in intent.

Ranking high in search engines involves hundreds of mysterious features of the google algorithm but the only three you need to care about are:

1. **Relevancy**: how closely do the keywords on your page match what a user is searching for?
2. **Authority**: how many backlinks does your page have? More probably means your content is better.
3. **Usefulness**: how organized and understandable is the content on your page?

## 2. Find untapped keywords

Start by brainstorming a few keywords people might search for who would get value from your business. For each of those keywords you can find related keywords by:

- searching that term on Google and looking in the "related keywords" section
- searching that term in Wikipedia and looking at the topics covered in the article
- use SEMRUSH's related keyword tool
- find subreddits and popular threads on reddit and look at the words used in the posts

Choose a few keywords to focus on based on:

- the monthly traffic volume of the keyword
- the difficulty of ranking for the keyword
- the keyword's relevancy to what you're selling
- the CPC of paid ads on that keyword
