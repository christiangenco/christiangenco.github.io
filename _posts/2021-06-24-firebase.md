# Firestore

# Google Cloud Storage

# Firebase Cloud Functions

## Environment variables

```
# set environment variables
firebase functions:config:set someservice.key="THE API KEY" someservice.id="THE CLIENT ID"

# get all environment variables
firebase functions:config:get
```

To read these environment variables from a firebase cloud function, use:

```js
const functions = require("firebase-functions");

functions.config().someservice.id;
```

To populate environment variables in your local environment (ex: when using ``):

```
firebase functions:config:get > .runtimeconfig.json
echo .runtimeconfig.json >> .gitignore
```

## `Error: Forbidden. Your client does not have permission to get URL /twitterSave from this server.`

Try explicitly allowing unauthenticated invocation of a function by adding the `allUsers` member id to the function with the `Cloud Functions Invoker` role in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/functions/) with [this guide from Google](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/securing/managing-access-iam#after_deployment).

# Deploying

## `Functions deploy had errors with the following functions`

Try:

- checking the output of `firebase --debug deploy --only functions`
- checking the output of `firebase functions:log`
- deleting the `us.artifacts.[Project ID].appspot.com` bucket in the [Cloud Storage page on Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser).
