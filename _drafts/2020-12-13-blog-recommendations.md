        <a href="https://www.gwern.net/">Gwern</a>: I imagine this blog is what
        it would look like to pry open a rigorous scientist's brain and see how
        they've optimized their life. I love his approach to
        <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Zeo">optimizing sleep</a>. He calculates
        the freakin' p-values for how correlated taking melatonin is to his
        sleep quality and randomly A/B tested two different mattresses. Who does
        that?!
