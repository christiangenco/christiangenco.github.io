        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/eXzuhya.jpg" /><p>Conventional wisdom says to spend one to three month&#39;s salary on your engagement ring. My fianc√©e and I are ardent <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/">Mustachians</a>, and found this figure to be both ludicrously large (we&#39;d much rather max out our Roth IRA&#39;s with that kind of money) and rather impersonal.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we decided to forgo a diamond (<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/02/have-you-ever-tried-to-sell-a-diamond/304575/">Have you ever tried to sell a diamond?</a>) with an identical looking cubic zirconia stone purchased on ebay for <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/CUBIC-ZIRCONIA-Loose-Round-Stone-CZ-USA-Shipper-Excellent-Quality-/121056313166?pt=Loose_Cubic_Zirconia&var=&hash=item1c2f84bf4e">about 1/1000th of what a similar sized diamond costs</a>. The trouble then was finding a good setting.</p>

<figure class="left"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2hO2UNHl.png" /><figcaption>Classical ring 2 from pinterest</figcaption></figure>

<p>Elisa had, conveniently, already been hard at work researching styles of rings she liked. She favored a classical look, but try as I might, I couldn&#39;t find the original source of the rings she&#39;d found, only rings that were <a href="http://www.moissaniteco.com/125ct-round-brilliant-cut-moissanite-antique-reproduction-ring-p-12960.html">similar, but not perfect</a>. Through lots of google image reverse image searching and random combinations of keywords, I stumbled on this ring pretty close to the ones Elisa liked that actually was for sale:</p>
<figure class="center-overflow"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2WV1Jac.jpg" /><figcaption>3-Stone Vine Engagement Ring from http://rosestonejewelry.com/</figcaption></figure>

<p>This ring came with an accompanying blog post that showed exactly how it was custom made. From the original sketches:</p>

<p>to the 3D sketch:</p>

<p>then 3D printed in wax:</p>

<p>then put in a lost wax casting plaster mold, filled with molten gold, and then dunked in a bucket of water so the plaster dissolves away:</p>

<p>The post went on to describe an additional 12 hours of detailing (chasing and engraving) that was done on this particular ring before setting the gem - a very expensive and labor intensive process that added some detail, but Elisa and I actually preferred the smoother non-engraved look.</p>
<p>This blew me away - I had no idea you could just <em>make</em> a ring by 3D printing it. I thought they were hand engraved by people with really tiny hands or something, but apparently this is now a common practice in jewelry making. Here&#39;s an excellent video on the entire process:</p>

<p>I contacted the designer of this ring, <a href="http://rosestonejewelry.com/">Jeshua Rosestone</a>, and asked for a quote for a ring without the blue side stones (neither Elisa or I liked them) resized for her finger. He promptly emailed back and explained that that ring was a custom order for $2,600, but that he could make the alterations and deliver a similar ring for us for $1,890.</p>
<p>This was still considerably more than I would have liked to spend on a ring (less money available to invest for retirement), so I asked how much a ring would be without the detailing. He emailed back understandably perturbed, but offered $250 for the raw 3D design and $200 for the gold casting, or $450 total.</p>
<p>This was considerably better, but I got a strong feeling that he wouldn&#39;t be too happy about this deal (it would be an order of magnitude lower than his typical jobs) and may be difficult to work with if we wanted to go through a few iterations. With this in mind, I ventured off to get quotes from other 3D modelers that I could work closer with, with plans of trying to learn the lost wax casting and metal molding myself (knowing that wax models could be 3D printed online).</p>
<p>I went through the top three 3D printing online services (<a href="http://i.materialise.com/">i.materialise</a>, <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/">shapeways</a>, and <a href="http://www.sculpteo.com/">sculpteo</a>) and tried to find designers that had made rings before that may be open to contract work. I found a great <a href="http://i.materialise.com/forum/index.php?/forum/23-3d-modeling-service/">forum page on i.materialise</a> of designer profiles and emailed every single one asking if they&#39;d be interested.</p>
<figure class="left-overflow"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UrS5uLrl.jpg" /><figcaption>Dani Epstein's detailed work.</figcaption></figure>

<p>I got a lot of rejects, and quotes all over the map: $200 to $600 (and remember, this is just for the design). I settled on moving forward with a designer named Dani Epstein, who had <a href="http://daniepstein.com/daniepstein/portfolio">a very impressive portfolio</a> including a piece of jewelry that had a lot of classical detail work.</p>
<p>He was also one of the lowest bids: he only charged ¬£20 GBP (~$40 USD) per hour, and gave an initial quote of 4 hours (¬£80 GBP, or $160). Through our email correspondence, I felt he was a guy that I could work back and forth with for tweaking.</p>
<p>I sent him images of all of the rings we liked and tried to sketch out what I wanted the end result to look like. After only two hours, he came back with this:</p>
<figure class="center-overflow"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZS6Gz0y.jpg" /><figcaption>first draft</figcaption></figure>

<p>I was blown away, and made a mental note to get really good at 3D modeling one day (I asked him for some resources to get started and he recommended the free <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> program).</p>
<p>Dani came back the next day with a design that was exactly what I&#39;d sketched out:</p>
<figure class="center-overflow"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qxOfsz7.jpg" /><figcaption>second draft</figcaption></figure>

<figure class="left-overflow"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VDYm1TYl.png" /><figcaption>3D file is too thin in some places</figcaption></figure>

<p>When seeing it all together, I didn&#39;t love the detail on the shoulders of the ring - the leafs were a little too much visually. Additionally, the 3D file had some trouble being printed (shapeways and i.materialise said a lot of areas were too thin).</p>
<p>We went back and forth a few times on various design changes and errors in the print process. The most embarrassing of which was that the ring was initially created with a 15.53mm <em>radius</em> instead of diameter. When this was fixed, the 6.5mm space for the stone was also shrunk by half, which we didn&#39;t discover until ordering a test print in plastic:</p>
<figure class="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bQSnAU6l.jpg" /><figcaption>test print in plastic</figcaption></figure>

<p>This was especially evident when compared with a 1 carat ring I bought on ebay for $12:</p>
<figure class="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nDCfpZKl.jpg" /><figcaption>diamond size is too small</figcaption></figure>

<p>A quick edit later and this too was fixed:</p>
<figure class="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MBYAnEDl.jpg" /><figcaption>diamond resized</figcaption></figure>

<p>Total, Dani charged ¬£170 GBP, or about $290 USD. For all the customizing we did, and the willingness and help Dani gave through the process, I&#39;m incredibly happy with how much I spent and how it turned out.</p>
<figure class="left-overflow"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/J9h27qMl.jpg" /><figcaption>silver 3D print arrived!</figcaption></figure>

<p>With this small change, I crossed my fingers and ordered the ring to be printed in silver (turns out the 3D printing companies will do the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvgYwYbvM0c">lost wax casting</a> and polishing for you). The day this arrived I was elated.</p>
<p>The level of detail was much better than in the plastic prints, likely from the polishing process. It looked like a real ring! The last step was figuring out how to get the cubic zirconia on there.</p>
<p>I searched on youtube to see if it was something I could just do. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE78pKFgdHQ">Some videos</a> made it look pretty easy, but for the quality and style of this ring it looked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKtCOw3tLCA">pretty complicated</a>. I opted to have it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgQRuYv2XSM">professionally done</a> at a local jewelry store.</p>
<p>They initially quoted $45, but Sophia (my sister) and I talked them down to $35.</p>
<p>Two days later and the finished ring was in my hands! A short while later, after engagement preparations had been made (parents&#39; permission asked, time and place arranged, trying to hide everything from Elisa until the final moment, etc.) and it was finally on her finger:</p>

<p>Total cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 carat CZ wedding ring (for emergency backup): $13.41</li>
<li>Handful of Cubic Zirconia stones in different sizes: $41.76</li>
<li>Design by Dani Epstein: $290</li>
<li>Handful of 3D printed rings to test different materials and size: $34.30</li>
<li>Test print in plastic: $28.05</li>
<li>Silver Print: $66.25</li>
<li>Ring mounting: $35</li>
<li><strong>Total: $508.77</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>However, if we wanted to print an identical copy, the marginal cost would only be:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 carat CZ stone: $5</li>
<li>Silver Print: $66.25</li>
<li>Ring mounting: $35</li>
<li><strong>Total for another ring: $106.25</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>It was a lot of back and forth through uncharted territory, and a lot of unnecessary expenses, but I&#39;m incredibly glad I went this route. The final ring - even with the extra overhead of learning the process as I went - was a fraction of the cost it would have been the traditional route, and feels like a much more personal token. At the same time, if the ring were ever lost, stolen, or damaged, we could sleep easily knowing we could have an identical copy made - perhaps even in a different material or with a different sized stone - in about two weeks for a hundred bucks.</p>
<p>Plus, now I have a perfect 3D model of Elisa&#39;s ring if we ever wanted to do something clever like make a chocolate mold out of it for wedding party favors or something.</p>
<p>tl;dr: 3D printed an engagement ring because we&#39;re living in the future. A++ would print again.</p>
<hr>
<p>Update: I also 3D printed my own wedding ring as a plain wedding band, modeled in <a href="https://www.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a>. Here&#39;s what it looks like:</p>

<hr>
<p>2019-06-14 Update: wow! I&#39;ve had so many people reach out to me asking about this process. Several have 3D printed rings of their own. If you&#39;ve 3D printed your ring from the advice in this article, send me a picture and I&#39;ll add it below!</p>
