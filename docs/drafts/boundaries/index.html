        <p>BP/NP communication is often vague, convoluted, and confusing, starting out with one topic and morphing into a dozen or more topics with no conclusions and no decisions made at the end. You may find yourself agreeing to things you don’t agree with or thinking that one conclusion has been made but the BP/NP insists it was a different conclusion. This type of communication is used to manipulate and control you into doing what the BP/NP wants.</p>

        <p>If you want to talk clearly about something that is bothering you, a good process to follow is the Yale communication model. Use it first with yourself to clarify what you actually feel and want. Then try it with your children. It works extremely well with kids. Then move on to using it with friends and at work. When you feel competent in its use, try it with the BP/NP:</p>

        <p>This model is a powerful means to communicate clearly with anyone and especially with highly sensitive or manipulative people. It conveys what you see is a problem, how you feel about it, and what you want. It is designed to be clear, concise, nonemotional, and nonjudgmental. Therefore, it is less likely to get off track and become attacking. It also does not require the BP/NP to do much of anything except listen. It is not a cure-all for every challenging communication with a BP/NP, but it is an effective tool.</p>

      <figure>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.huxley.net/bnw/four.html">
        <p>The model begins with a statement of an observable fact, such as “When I see dirty clothes all over the living room . . . ,” “When I hear a loud voice and sharp words . . . ,” “When I get a statement in the mail saying the checking account is overdrawn . . . ,” or “When I expect to have dinner at 5 p.m. and it isn’t made until 9 p.m. . . .” Although you are saying statement to a particular person, notice that no one is specifically being blamed. This can waylay a defensive response from the other person while he or she waits to hear what you are going to say next. You will notice that the word “you” is purposely not used. Saying, “You are . . . ,” “You did . . . ,” “You always . . . ,” “You never . . .” and so on is just an invitation to a fight. Leaving out “you” also lessens the desire of the other person to be defensive. Leaving out the word “you” can give you a chance to be heard, with less chance of the BP/NP being instantly defensive.</p>

        <p>The next step is to clearly state your own feelings about the event. Saying, “I feel taken advantage of . . . ” or “I feel angry, hurt, and humiliated” gives the other person information about how the event affected you. Again, you are not saying the word “you,” nor are you saying that the other person “made you feel” this way. By taking responsibility for your own feelings, you are ending the blame game. You feel the way you do just because you do. Accepting your own feelings is an important step in getting others to take your feelings seriously. Being able to put your own feelings into words, to learn to know how things affect you, and to ultimately figure out what you want is also a significant way to validate yourself and feel more powerful.</p>

        <p>With most people, you may not need much more than these two statements to make it clear what you feel. There is really nothing much more intimate than telling people how you feel. It is uniquely personal window into who you are. People who love you, respect you, and care about how you feel will respond with appropriate concern. They may actually ask you about the next step: What do you want?</p>

        <blockquote cite="https://www.huxley.net/bnw/four.html">
        <p>The third step is letting the other person know what you want. “I would like to be talked to in a quiet voice,” “I want this picked up right away,” and “I would really appreciate your telling me ahead of time that you will be late” are all possible ways (from mild to strong) to convey your request for an action or a change in what is happening. When challenging a rule or the behavior of another person, it is more effective to be specific. Saying that you want to be “happy or supported or cared for” is too vague for the other person to actually know what to do differently.</p>

        <p>Asking for what you want can be a challenge. You may find it hard to give yourself permission to ask for your wants to be considered. You may also think that by calling something a need, it will make it more important and powerful. However, the BP/NP is more affected by what you want. When you call something a need when it really is not, the BP/NP will challenge you and work to convince you that you don’t actually need it. When you identify something as a want, it then becomes harder for the BP/NP to sound sane and reasonable if he or she tries to convince you that you don’t actually want what you just said you wanted. Remember that the only other alternative to saying what you want is to manipulate and/or expect the other person to read your mind, or to give up the want altogether. To be an adult living the life you want to live, you have to have the courage to make polite requests of others to get what you want.</p>

        <p>Before you move to the last step in the communication model, stop to see what the other person chooses to do. If the person is willing to cooperate at this point and do what you ask, great. Or this may be the time when the other person offers to negotiate, such as in the following examples:</p>

        <ul>
<li>“I’ll talk more quietly, but I really want to deal with this issue now.”</li>
<li>“I’m sorry I was late. I tried your cell phone, but it seems to be off.”</li>
<li>Be on the lookout for passive-aggressive responses from the BP/NP, such as the following:</li>
<li>“You shouldn’t feel that way.”</li>
<li>“I don’t see why you have to be so bossy.”</li>
<li>“Everything is always about what you want.”</li>
<li>Or there may be no response at all. These responses indicate a person who does not want to change, do any thing differently, or respect your feelings and wants. A healthy way to disagree with what you have requested is for the other person to say the following:</li>
<li>“I really don’t want to do that.”</li>
<li>“I’m not willing to take that action right now.”</li>

        <blockquote cite="https://www.huxley.net/bnw/four.html">
        <p>Straightforward disagreement allows the two of you to negotiate and perhaps find a third possibility that will be satisfactory to both of you. BP/NPs rarely negotiate because they feel certain that their own needs and wants will be ignored. They have learned to demand and grab to get their wants met. By using this new communication model, you may be able to introduce the idea of negotiation and demonstrate that you will listen to them as well as expecting to be listened to.</p>

        <p>If the other person ignores you, says absolutely “no,” or is passive-aggressive, you will need to consider using the last step in the model. The statement “Or I will need to . . .” is not to be used as a threat or a punishment. It is to be a statement of what you will do to take care of yourself without the cooperation of the other person, for example, “If you can’t lower your voice, I will need to excuse myself from this conversation.” The most powerful tool you have at this point is to stop interacting with the other person. You cannot be taken advantage of or forced to keep talking if you don’t cooperate. The action you choose to take at this point must, obviously, be under your control and not depend on the other person doing anything more. This is the key to creating change in any relationship. You always have control over changing how available you are and what you decide to think and do. Keep in mind that you must follow through with what you say you will do, or you will not be taken seriously in the future. Here are some examples:</p>

<li> I feel lost, and I would really like to be able to discuss our different options.</li>
<li> I would like to focus on one topic to discuss right now. <em>wait for response</em></li>
<li>Otherwise, I will have to continue this discussion another time when I am not so confused.”
 Here’s another example:</li>
<li> “I’m not feeling that I’m having much fun here at the party.</li>
<li> I’ve decided I’d like to go home.</li>
<li> What would you like to do? <em>wait for a response</em></li>
<li>So I’m going to head on home now.”
 Here’s another:</li>
<li> “When I come home at 10 p.m. from class and see that the kitchen still needs to be cleaned up from dinner,</li>
<li>I feel disappointed.</li>
<li>I would really like it to be cleaned up by morning so that I can make breakfast. <em>wait for a response</em></li>

        <p>This model works best when you talk in a calm, confident, and relaxed voice without threats or any kind of hysteria. You also must be willing to face unexpected challenges. No one can absolutely predict the behavior of another person, so be prepared to focus on taking care of yourself no matter what the other person decides to do. Be prepared to hear “no,” be prepared for the BP/NP to be upset or unhappy in some way, be prepared to let the other person speak up for what he or she wants without rescuing or automatically giving in, and be prepared for the BP/NP to make irrelevant comments to get you off topic.</p>

        <p>Follow through by taking care of yourself the way you said you would. If you say you will take a new action and then you don’t follow through, this gives the BP/NP the message that your needs and wants aren’t serious. If you are serious about making your life better, think through what you are willing to do, make a plan, and take these new actions.</p>
