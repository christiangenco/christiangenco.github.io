Hi! Here's my life update for the past two months.

If you're more of a watcher than a reader, here's my video update instead:

# 1. Health

## ðŸ’‰ Levels continuous blood glucose monitor

This blurb grew big enough that I split it up into its own blog post about [continuous blood glucose monitoring](/glucose). tl;dr: my normal ketogenic diet keeps my glucose smooth and steady (except at night when I get hypoglycemic but I think that's okay), and carbs from white rice are especially bad for me now.

## ðŸŒ¦ Low Vitamin D

This blurb grew big enough that I split it up into its own blog post about [how to get enough vitamin D](/d). tl;dr: I don't know yet, but I'm trying supplements and using a UVB lamp made for lizards in adition to spending time as naked as possible outside.

## ðŸ›¢ High LDL

This blurb grew big enough that I split it up into its own blog post about [if high LDL on the ketogenic diet is bad](/ldl). tl;dr: no, it's fine.

## ðŸŒ¬ Awair Air quality monitor for christmas gifts

Make sure you're humidifying your air if your heat is on:

If you don't have one, my favorite right now is the [LEVOIT](https://amzn.to/2LUPhZV): it fills from the top so you can refill it from a bottle while it's running, it's super easy to clean, doesn't have any stupid extra features, and looks sorta like Apple made it.

## ðŸ’ª Pullup counter
