I was given a sheet of [pre- and post-operative instructions for my wisdom teeth extraction](/pdf_articles/terrible-operative-instructions.pdf) that were terrible and confusing, so I rewrote them to be easier to follow.

These instructions make a classic mistake of being egocentrically aligned from the doctor's perspective instead of from the patient's perspective.

Here's an example of why these instructions are poorly written: say it's been three days since your surgery, you just woke up, you're hungry, and your mouth hurts. You look in the fridge and see some precooked sausages, a carton of milk, bread, eggs, and lettuce. In the pantry is a bag of potato chips, spices, some La Croix sparkling water, and some instant rice.

Given the following snippets of discharge instructions you were given, what do you do next?

> **24 Hour Rule – DO NOT RINSE YOUR MOUTH, SPIT, USE A STRAW, CHEW HARD FOOD, BRUSH YOUR TEETH, OR LOOK IN YOUR MOUTH FOR 24 HOURS.** After 24 hours, rinse your mouth GENTLY with salt water. Rinse for one minute twice a day for seven days. **Do not rinse on day of surgery.** > **-PAIN MEDICATION / ANTIBIOTICS**: Pick up the prescriptions on your way home. Take medication with a cup of liquid or a serving of food. **_Never take medication on an empty stomach._** To avoid nausea while taking pain medication: Eat soft foods, remain in a reclined position and take it easy for the first couple of days.
>
> 1. Take antibiotic (amoxicillin or clindamycin) as instructed on medicine bottle.
> 2. Take Medrol Dose Pack as directed on package until completely gone. Do not stop taking unless directed.
> 3. Only fill and take the prescription for Zofran if needed for nausea. Follow instructions on medicine bottle.
>    -DIET -- Drink a lot of fluids. Avoid all foods that require chewing for the first 2 days: (Ensure, smoothies (no straw), ice cream, yogurt, soup, mashed potatoes, pudding, jello and similar). After 2 days, you should begin eating soft foods that require chewing so your jaw doesn’t get tight and cause pain: (Banana, pancakes, eggs, larger pastas, soft sandwiches, cooked vegetables, and similar). You can also chew gum to prevent tightening of jaw. Remember to rinse your mouth gently with warm salt water after eating. **\*Avoid crunchy and small things (chips, rice, corn, and oatmeal)** until day 7 when you start using syringe. NO STRAWS FOR AT LEAST 7 DAYS.

Compare those instructions with these:

> Day 3:
>
> - **If you feel pain**:
>   - apply heat
>   - eat or drink something, then take 2 tablets of Ultracet or 1 tablet of Tylenol #3 or 2 over the counter 500mg Tylenol
>   - if you've taken Ultracet or Tylenol and are still in pain 4 hours later, take 800mg Ibuprofen or 2 200mg over the counter Ibuprofen
>   - if you're still in pain 4 hours after that, you can take Ultracet or Tylenol again and keep alternating with Ibuprofen.
> - **If you feel hungry**:
>   - eat soft foods that require chewing so your jaw doesn't get tight and cause pain: banana, pancakes, eggs, larger pastas, soft sandwiches, cooked veggies, and similar
>   - rinse your mouth gently with warm salt water after eating

Those later instructions are easier to read because they're written from the patient's perspective. In software entrepreneurship we call this technique Human Centered Design.

Hey, I'm not a doctor, this is not medical advice, etc.

Also: oh my god, doctors get your shit together. How are people supposed to follow your logic puzzle discharge instructions _while_ going through surgery? Come on now you can do better.

## Before scheduling the surgery

- If you're pregnant, don't

## A week before

- arrange for someone to drive you to and from surgery (you can't drive yourself) and spend the rest of the day in the same room as you.
- plan for two days of liquid food (soylent, smoothies, soup, ice cream, yogurt, mashed potatoes, pudding, jellow, or similar)
- Get some gum
- Get an ice pack and a heat pack
- if you have fake nails or dark nail polish, get it taken off. The color of your nails is important for the anesthesiologist to make sure you're not dying.
- Don't have any alcohol, smoke, vape, or use any recreational drugs because it could mess with your tolerance to the sedative medications and you might wake up in the middle of dental surgery which would be horrifying.

## The day before

- Don't have any grapefruit because it messes with some medications (specifically, it interferes with drug metabolism via CYP450 enzymes in the liver)
- Don't eat or drink anything (even water) after midnight. You need to have fasted for at least eight hours before your surgery to minimize the risk that you vomit and then choke on your own vomit while sedated.
- Mix up a big bottle of salt water to rinse your mouth out for meals (after the first 24 hours)
- Hey good job taking care of your health! Do something relaxing a few hours before bed.
- Plan some relaxing activities you can do while stationary tomorrow. Video games? Netflix binge?

## The morning of your surgery

- Hey good job taking care of your health! Remember to breathe.
- wear short sleeves so the doctors can access your arms to put in an IV for sedation drugs

## Immediately after waking up from your surgery

- you might feel uncomfortable, have swelling, bleed, and not be able to open your jaw all the way: that's normal.
- gently but firmly bite down on the gauze in your mouth to control bleeding

## On your way home

- Stop by a pharmacy to pick up your prescriptions for:
  - an antibiotic (amoxicillin or cindamycin)
  - a Medrol Dose Pack (an antiinflamatory steroid)
  - Zofran, but only if you feel nautious
  - Ultracet or Tylenol and Ibuprofen for pain

## When you get home

- change your gauze and let it stay in your mouth for up to one hour (so you've had gauze in your mouth for about two hours total).
  - if bleeding is excessive, check that the gauze is as far back in your mouth as possible. You may bite on tea bags to help stop bleeding.
- lay down with your head elevated and take a nap. Blood pressure and bleeding decrease when sleeping.
- Try not to talk or move excessively.
- While your driver and post-surgery companion is hanging out in the same room as you for your nap, ask them to write out a schedule with checkboxes for when you're going to take that medication for the next week. Plan to eat or drink something before taking any medication to avoid nausea.

## Day 1 (the day of your surgery)

- **Don't**:
  - rinse your mouth—the blood clots in your mouth are delicate and might get dislodged with sloshing water
  - spit—pressure in your mouth might dislodge your blood clots and you could get dry socket
  - use a straw—pressure in your mouth might dislodge your blood clots
  - chew hard food-it might dislodge those blood clots
  - brush your teeth-a big stick in your mouth might, you guessed it, dislodge those blood clots
  - look in your mouth—ahh blood!
  - talk or move excessively—movement might... well, you can probably guess.
- **Do**:
  - take your antibiotic (amoxicillin or clindamycin) as instructed on the medicine bottle
  - take your antiinflamatory steroid Medrol Dose Pack as instructed
  - rest, nap, netflix, and chill (but only if it's actual chilling)

- **If you feel nauseous**:
  - take your anti-nausea Zofran as directed on the bottle

Hey you did it! Good job taking care of yourself. I'm proud of you.
