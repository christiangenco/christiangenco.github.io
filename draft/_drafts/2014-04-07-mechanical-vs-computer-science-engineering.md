I got an email recently from a friend at SMU, Caleb Kyle, asking for my opinion on Mechanical vs. Computer Science Engineering as an undergraduate college major.

I have [very strong opinions](http://christian.gen.co/go-to-college-for-free/) on going to college at all, but I thought the thread brought up interesting contrasts between the two engineering disciplines: in a world where [software is eating the world](http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/04/22/always-early-marc-andreessens-five-big-ideas-that-have-shaped-the-internet/), will Mechanical Engineering still exist, or will it just become an offshoot of 3D modeling?

> Christian,

> I have been somewhat dissatisfied with mechanical engineering recently and have considered switching to Computer Science, sticking with ME and minoring in CS (which is a pretty tough load), and majoring in CS and minoring in ME.  I took Java this semester which has been my first exposure to CS and have absolutely loved it.  I love the creativity aspects, how there are so many ways to solve one problem.  I love how easily/quickly/cheaply I can build something (whereas if I want to build anything useful that's mechanical it takes a lot more time/overhead cost, like buying a lathe, to even prototype. Its then even more costly to actually produce a product). 

> I love the entrepreneurial opportunities with CS and how easy it is to create the nuts and bolts of a web business or an app.  I think its cool how easily programmers can do freelance work.  I really like a lot of the CS work environments; I like how you can work in a coffee house, in a park, on a bus, in a plane, anywhere.  And the corporate CS environments seem to me to be more hip and enjoyable. 

> Enough about me. A few questions i've asked a lot of folks is: why are you a computer scientist?  What drew you to it originally and what kept you there? What do you want to do with it out of college? Where do you see yourself working?  

> Finally, how do I know if I want to be a computer scientist? How do I know if I want to do this for college and my profession, or if its just something to do more on the side (more as a hobby, like for DIY projects, or maybe for freelance work on the side).

> Thank you for your help and insights.  I'm trying to figure all this out before I sign up for classes in mid April.

> Best,

Here was my response:

> Oh hey, awesome! Your analysis of CSE is spot on - it's much easier to prototype, iterate, and ship when your entire pipeline is software.

> That said, don't completely discount ME: it's one of the most exciting times in history to be in hardware. 3D printing, mockup software (with which you can work from home), and Kickstarter have made it much easier to get into the market, and hardware has (potentially) more reach into the physical world than you could do with purely software. The most powerful products are a mix of both (see the recently announced https://fresh.amazon.com/dash).

> To your questions: I'm a programmer because programming is the most rewarding and satisfying activities I've ever done with my time. It's always new, always fresh, and always the damn hardest thing I've ever done. I see, several times daily, vast swaths of human machinery that I can immediately envision being completely replaced by a piece of software I construct in my head, and (if time and feasibility permit) then I make it.

> There is no other activity I've yet discovered that offers this freedom, flexibility, and power. The money's great too.

> I've been doing freelance work, and working mostly for myself on one of my website business ventures. I plan to keep doing this and am working towards a more stable SAS product that will offer a comfy amount of recurring revenue so I can do this in a few years: http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/

> My advice at the end of that talk is *not* to become a professional programmer, but to bring what you've learned to another area (which for you, I'd wager, is mechanical engineering). If in the process of doing that, you find yourself more drawn to programming than what you were doing before, more power to you.

> Best,
